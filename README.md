Homework Assignment 10

The purpose of this program was to create a mock version of amazon, hence 'Bamazon'. It's basically an app that allows a user to purchase an item and a certain quantity of said item.
This is done by entering a product code, followed by a quantity.
If the user enters an invalid code, the program will inform the user that Bamazon does not carry that product.
If the item is out of stock or the user enters a quantity greater than what is available, the user will be informed that the product is out of stock.
